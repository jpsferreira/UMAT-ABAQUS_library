UMAT-ABAQUS_library | A library with user-defined material models for soft biological tissues and filamentous networks. | A framework to test material response under multiple loading conditions.

# Description

This library provides subroutines for 3D implementation of large deformation constitutive behavior using continuum mechanics. The code is written in either fixed-form or modern Fortran. You can use it as a primary subroutine interface for ABAQUS (Dassault Systèmes) as a UMAT or an interface for your own finite element code. 

Each material model comprises: source code and a one-element ABAQUS example. 

This repository also has a framework to test the material response under multiple loading conditions, in particular:
* Load type: Monotonic and cyclic loading 
* Homogeneous deformation mode: Uniaxial, biaxial, simple shear and pure shear

This repository is oriented for experienced researchers in biomechanics and continuum mechanics. You are highly welcome to use these open-resource codes for your non-commercial usage; please cite the below papers. Pull requests are welcome. 

# Requirements
- ABAQUS 6.14-1 or higher and Intel Fortran Compiler 2017 or higher
- GNU Fortran Compiler 5.4.0 or higher
- Python 3.6 or higher

* Get GNU Fortran Compiler
```bash
apt install gcc gfortran
```
# Compiling

Simple bash scripts at each directory are provided for building with gfortran. The code can also be compiled with the Intel Fortran Compiler (and presumably any other Fortran compiler that supports modern standards). A Makefile is provided for compiling the code with the GNU Fortran compiler.

- create UMATs (run 2x times)
```bash
make build
make build
```
- clean UMATs
```bash
make clean
```
-  unit test UMATs
```bash
make test
```

# Future Releases
- [ ] Add more material models
